> [!NOTE]  
> This library is currently in preparation for v0.5 with many breaking changes. For the documentation of the current crates.io v0.4.0, visit the [docs](https://docs.rs/ros_pointcloud2/0.4.0/ros_pointcloud2/). Since rclrs still needs a workaround, the version number must be changed to your desired version which supports rclrs (currently only v0.4.0) â€” regardless of the version number shown in this Readme.

ros_pointcloud2 uses its own type for the message `PointCloud2Msg` to keep the library framework agnostic. ROS1 and ROS2 are supported with feature flags.

Get started with the example below, check out the other use cases in the `examples` folder or see the [Documentation](https://docs.rs/ros_pointcloud2/0.5.0-rc.1/) for a complete guide.

## Quickstart

```rust
use ros_pointcloud2::prelude::*;

// PointXYZ (and many others) are provided by the crate.
let cloud_points = vec![
  PointXYZI::new(91.486, -4.1, 42.0001, 0.1),
  PointXYZI::new(f32::MAX, f32::MIN, f32::MAX, f32::MIN),
];

let out_msg = PointCloud2Msg::try_from_vec(cloud_points).unwrap();

// Convert the ROS crate message type, we will use r2r here.
// let msg: r2r::sensor_msgs::msg::PointCloud2 = out_msg.into();
// Publish ...

// ... now incoming from a topic.
// let in_msg: PointCloud2Msg = msg.into();
let in_msg = out_msg;

let processed_cloud = in_msg.try_into_iter().unwrap()
  .map(|point: PointXYZ| { // Define the info you want to have from the Msg.
      // Some logic here ...

      point
  })
  .collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

## Integrations

There are currently 3 integrations for common ROS crates.

You can use `rosrust` and `r2r` by enabling the respective feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
ros_pointcloud2 = { version = "*", features = ["r2r_msg", "derive"]}
# or
ros_pointcloud2 = { version = "*", features = ["rosrust_msg", "derive"]}
```

### rclrs (ros2_rust)

Features do not work properly with `rcrls` because the messages are linked externally. You need to use tags instead:

```toml
[dependencies]
ros_pointcloud2 = { git = "https://github.com/stelzo/ros_pointcloud2", tag = "v0.5.0-rc.1_rclrs" }
```

Also, indicate the following dependencies to your linker inside the `package.xml` of your package.

```xml
<depend>std_msgs</depend>
<depend>sensor_msgs</depend>
<depend>builtin_interfaces</depend>
```

Please open an issue or PR if you need other integrations.

## Performance

This library offers a speed up when compared to PointCloudLibrary (PCL) conversions but the specific factor depends heavily on the use case and system.
The `_vec` conversions are on average ~6x faster than PCL while the single core iteration `_iter` functions are around ~2x faster.
Parallelization with `_par_iter` gives a ~9x speed up compared to an OpenMP accelerated PCL pipeline.

The results are measured on an Intel i7-14700 with benchmarks from [this repository](https://github.com/stelzo/ros_pcl_conv_bench).

For minimizing the conversion overhead in general, always use the functions that best fit your use case.

## `no_std` Environments

The `_iter` conversions are compatible with `#[no_std]` environments if an allocator is provided. This is due to the fact that names for point fields do not have a maximum length, and PointCloud2 data vectors can have arbitrary sizes. Use `default-features = false` to disable std for this crate. Only `nalgebra` can be added as an additional feature in this case.

### type-layout
For compatibility reasons, a patched version of `type-layout` is included in this repository. The original crate can be found [here](https://crates.io/crates/type-layout). After the patch is applied on the original `type-layout` crate ([PR](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/type-layout/pull/9)), the local dependency will be changed to the original crate.
